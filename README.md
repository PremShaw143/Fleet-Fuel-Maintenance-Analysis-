#Project Overview
This project analyzes vehicle fleet data to track fuel efficiency, maintenance costs, and overall performance. 
The goal is to provide actionable insights for cost optimization, resource management, and predictive maintenance.

1. Fuel Efficiency Analysis (MPG):

Calculated miles per gallon (MPG) for each vehicle.
Determined average fuel efficiency across the fleet.

2. Maintenance Cost Analysis:

Identified vehicles with the highest maintenance costs.
Calculated Cost per Mile to evaluate cost-effectiveness.

3. Distance vs Fuel Consumption:

Analyzed correlation between distance travelled and fuel consumed.
Visualized the relationship using Python plots.

4. Vehicle Status Analysis:

Counted Active vs In Service vehicles.
Calculated percentage distribution for fleet monitoring.

5. Time-Based Trends:

Tracked fuel consumption and maintenance costs over time to detect patterns.
Highlighted seasonality and operational trends.

6. Predictive Analytics:

Applied Linear Regression to predict fuel consumption based on distance travelled.

#Top 10 Analysis:

Ranked vehicles by highest maintenance cost and highest fuel consumption using Excel Pivot Tables and Python.

Dashboard & Visualization:
Built an interactive Excel dashboard with Pivot Tables, charts, and Conditional Formatting.
Created Python visualizations for deeper insights (Bar Charts, Scatter Plots, Trend Lines).
